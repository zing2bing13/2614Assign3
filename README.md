Simple C# program to read a CSV file and display its results on the console screen

This was my solution to a programming assignment in my C# class.

The task was as follows:
Write a console application that:
1) reads a file containing data about the results of sports games
2) stores the data in a collection of data classes
3) displays the data from the collection in a visually pleasing way

The program must do just these three things and then quitâ€”that is all.
The program should be able to handle two sports: tennis and hockey. However, your design should
make it relatively easy to add more sports in the future. For this assignment, we will be expecting
you to use polymorphism when you design the classes related to a sport.
